# IC-Engine
IC-Engine is a fully featured, cross platofrm 2-D game engine written in C++
## Features
* IC-Engine implements a high-level programming paradigm known as [ECS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system) (Entity Component Systems)
* Using ECS, IC-Engine is both highly flexable and blazing fast, complex games can be created through creation of components and systems alone, without ever needing to modfy the engine itself
* Robust logging using [spdlog](https://github.com/gabime/spdlog) as a backend
* Bulit in support for benchmarking
* Efficient but accurate physics engine
* Rudimentary but effective audio engine
* Tilemap support
* Level creation integration with [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/)
* Experimental multi-threaded fork of the engine
